# Technical Details
Feedit uses Python based Flask with Javascript based React. The API routes work with a PostgreSQL database.

Account related routes are protected with user authentication, meaning all actions that require ownership are only allowed by the correct logged in user.

Posts can be viewed through different feeds, using subfeedits as categories.

Posts can be created, edited, or deleted by an authorized logged in user.

Data fetched from the API routes are used to populate feeds, manipulate posts, and work with subscriptions to customize said feeds and posts.

A user can use the search bar to query for posts containing the query in either the title or the content of the post.


# Todo:


* General site design
* Bug fix on removing subscriptions

* Voting
